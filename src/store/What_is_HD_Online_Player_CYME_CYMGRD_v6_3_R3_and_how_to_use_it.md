The software has several features that make it suitable for playing video files. Some of them are:
 
- It can play video files from local computer, network and servers.
- It supports various video formats, such as AVI, MP4, MKV, WMV, FLV, etc.
- It also supports DVD and Blu-ray discs.
- It has a simple and user-friendly interface.
- It allows you to adjust the video settings, such as brightness, contrast, saturation, etc.
- It supports subtitles and audio tracks.
- It can create playlists and bookmarks.

To use the software, you need to install it on your computer. You can download it from the official website of CYME International[^1^]. After installing it, you can launch it and select the video file you want to play. You can also drag and drop the file into the software window. You can use the buttons on the toolbar or the keyboard shortcuts to control the playback. You can also right-click on the video screen to access more options.
 
If you want to play video files from the web, you need to install some third-party software, such as JW Player[^2^]. JW Player is a web-based video player that can stream video files from various sources. You can embed it into your website or blog using HTML code. To play video files using JW Player, you need to copy the URL of the video file and paste it into the HD Online Player (CYME CYMGRD v6 3 R3) window. The software will then load the JW Player and play the video file.
 
HD Online Player (CYME CYMGRD v6 3 R3) is a useful software for playing high-quality video files on your computer. It is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 and 10. It requires a minimum of 512 MB of RAM and 100 MB of free disk space. It also requires a DirectX 9.0c compatible graphics card and sound card.
  
One of the benefits of using HD Online Player (CYME CYMGRD v6 3 R3) is that it can help you design and analyze substation grounding grids. Substation grounding grids are essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of electrical systems. They provide a low-resistance path for fault currents to flow to the ground and prevent dangerous voltages from appearing on equipment and structures. They also protect personnel from electric shocks and electrocution.
 
HD Online Player (CYME CYMGRD v6 3 R3) is based on the CYMGRD module, which is a software that conforms to IEEE standards for substation grounding grid design and analysis[^1^]. The software uses finite element analysis to calculate the ground potential rise, touch and step voltages, earth surface potential, and current distribution in the grid. It also allows you to evaluate the danger points and optimize the grid design by changing the conductor size, spacing, depth, and layout. You can also model different soil structures, such as uniform, two-layer, or multilayer soils.
 
Another benefit of using HD Online Player (CYME CYMGRD v6 3 R3) is that it has a user-friendly interface and powerful graphical facilities. The software allows you to enter the grid data using a spreadsheet or a graphical editor. You can also import the grid data from other sources, such as AutoCAD or Google Earth. The software displays the grid geometry and results in 2D or 3D views. You can also generate various reports and charts to document your analysis and design.
